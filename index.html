        <h3> So What is it really?</h3>
            <p6> <a href="https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/basic-clafoutis-51208430">Clafoutis</a> is a baked French dessert of fruit, traditionally black cherries, arranged in a buttered dish and covered 
                with a thick flan-like batter. The clafoutis is dusted with powdered sugar and served lukewarm, sometimes with cream.
                The clafoutis comes from the Limousin region of France, and while black cherries are traditional, there are numerous variations 
                using other fruits, including red cherries, plums, prunes, apples, pears, cranberries or blackberries. When other kinds of fruit 
                are used instead of cherries, the dish is properly called a flaugnarde. The dish's name derives from Occitan clafotís, from the verb clafir, meaning "to fill" (implied: "the batter with cherries").
                Clafoutis apparently spread throughout France during the 19th century.</p6>
